# 531-Workout-Creator
This script automatically formats and syncs your weekly workout from a standard google sheets template to dropbox

## **Project Scope:**
This project is designed to simplify the popular Wendler 5-3-1 workout. The workout is designed around 4 week workout cycles and focuses on the main compound exercises (Squat, deadlift, bench, overhead press). The end goal of the workout is to achieve consistent strength gain over a long period of time by consistently add weight to your 1 rep max after each month long cycle.

Due to the nature of the workout, it's a little difficult to keep track of weights (due to the fact that all weights are calculated as %tages of your one rep max). This project is designed to simplify that process so the focus can shift from figuring out your weekly weights, to getting those gains.

## **To do List:**
1. Class rollups / General code optimizations
2. Incorporate final output table for easy weight references for core exercies
3. Support workout generation for multiple users
4. Automatically run on a weekly cadence
5. Standardize google sheets format for easy editing of accessory workouts
6. Refactor Accessory Workout generator for additional flexibility
